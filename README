== What is BrocadeSAN?

BrocadeSAN provides a simple API to communicate with Brocade SAN switches using CLI SSH connection.
You have option to either run the command manualy or query the switch with pre-defined set of methods.

== Basic Usage

You can use BrocadeSAN in 2 different ways:

=== 1. Query the SAN switch directly using 1 connection per command query 

  # this will query the switch name and version and open connection to switch twice
  
  switch=SanSwitch.new("address","user","password")
  
  switch.name
  switch.version
  
=== 2. Query the SAN switch in session block using 1 connection per session
  
  # this will query the switch name and version and open connection to switch only once
  
  switch=SanSwitch.new("address","user","password")
  
  switch.session do 
	switch.name
	switch.version
  end
