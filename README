= BrocadeSAN

== What is BrocadeSAN?

BrocadeSAN provides a simple API to communicate with Brocade SAN switches using CLI SSH connection.
You have option to either run the command manualy or query the switch with pre-defined set of methods.

== Basic Usage

You can use BrocadeSAN in 2 different ways:

=== 1. Query the SAN switch directly using 1 connection per command query 

  # this will query the switch name and version and open connection to switch twice
  
  switch=Brocade::SAN::Switch.new("address","user","password")
  
  switch.name
  switch.firmware
  
=== 2. Query the SAN switch in session block using 1 connection per session
  
  # this will query the switch name and version and open connection to switch only once
  
  switch=Brocade::SAN::Switch.new("address","user","password")
  
  switch.session do 
	switch.name
	switch.firmare
  end
  
== Special Usage

If the API is not sufficient for your need you can always utilize the Brocade::SAN::Switch#query method to execute arbitrary commands
  
  # sends command to switch
  response=switch.query("portshow | grep Online ")
  
  # sends several commands to switch
  response=switch.query("switchshow","cfgshow")
  
  # calls interactive command and sends response along the way
  # the mode has to be set to interactive
  # the mode will persist across queries
  # change it back to :script when you want to run non-interactive command
  switch.set_mode :interactive 
  response=switch.query("cfgsave","y")
  
Response is type of Brocade::SAN::Switch::Response. You can get the data by calling +data+ and errors by calling +errors+.

The data will be raw output from the switch with each cmd prefixed by defined/default prompt.
